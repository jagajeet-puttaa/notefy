                One fine day, he dared the tortoise to a race in order to exhibit his skills in front of other
                animals in the forest. Fed up with the hare?s bragging, the tortoise finally accepted the challenge
                and decided to compete him in a race. On the day of the race, all the animals of the forest gathered
                to watch the competition between the hare and the tortoise. Just as they were about to begin the
                race, the hare mocked the tortoise for accepting the challenge. Further, he also mentioned that soon
                after he wins the race, the tortoise would be ridiculed by other animals for accepting the dare.
                Seeing the tortoise close to the finish line, the hare rushed towards it as fast as he could.
                However, it was too late and the tortoise finally crossed the finish line, thereby winning the
                competition. When the hare reached the point where the race ended, all the animals were laughing at
                him for losing the race to the tortoise
