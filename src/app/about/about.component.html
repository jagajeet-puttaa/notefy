        <p class="card-text">In the present industry, communication is the key element to progress. Passing on information, to the right person, and in the right manner is very important, not just on a corporate level, but also on a personal level. The world is moving towards digitization, so are the means of communication. Phone calls, emails, text messages etc. have become an integral part of message conveyance in this tech-savvy world. In order to serve the purpose of effective communication between two parties without hindrances, many applications have come to picture, which acts as a mediator and help in effectively carrying messages in form of text, or speech signals over miles of networks. Most of these applications find the use of conversion from speech signals to text. Devise a way for the conversion of voice-based recording of online lessons to PDF/Word Documents. Compare the accuracy of what is spoken in the voice-based recording to the text in converted PDF/Word Document. The project aims to provide students with text based PDF/Word Document of their online classes given they are voice based in nature. The accuracy must of the proposed solution must be taken into account.</p>
